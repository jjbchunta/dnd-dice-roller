        <h1>Writing Dice Expressions</h1>
        <p>
            When interacting with the home page, you'll see a list of input
            fields similar to the ones displayed below:
        </p>
        <div>
            <table id="ability_table"></table>
        </div>
        <p>
            All of these input fields are the slots where you can enter your
            character's spell's dice expressions for each ability level. And a
            dice expression is just the math that goes behind a cast.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's say you had a spell that takes 2 rolls of a 8 sided dice, and
            adds your strength modifier to the result of those two rolls. To
            write out this expression, you'd use the proper notation to
            represent these different calculations.
        </p>
        <p>
            The dice rolls for that example would be represented with the
            expression <strong>2d8</strong>, where the first number is the times
            you roll the dice, the second number is the sides of that dice, and
            the <strong>d</strong> seperates the two. Everytime this expression
            is evaluated, the result is random.
        </p>
        <p>
            Furthermore, once you define your stat sheet, your ability modifiers
            can be included by using the slug for that ability. The bonuses
            being automatically calculated.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Strength = <strong>str</strong></li>
            <li>Dexterity = <strong>dex</strong></li>
            <li>Constitution = <strong>con</strong></li>
            <li>Intelligence = <strong>int</strong></li>
            <li>Wisdom = <strong>wis</strong></li>
            <li>Charisma = <strong>cha</strong></li>
            <li>Proficiency = <strong>prof</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Meaning it would just be a matter of writing out simple math inside
            of one of your ability fields to have the computer evaluate a dice
            expression for you. And to represent our original example, our dice
            expression would be:
        </p>
        <div>
            <table id="ability_table">
                <tr>
                    <td><label>Ability #</label></td>
                    <td>
                        <div>
                            <select name="ability_spell" class="select_spell" ability="1" disabled=""></select>
                            <input type="text" class="manual_spell" disabled="" value="2d8 + str">
                        </div>
                    </td>
                    <td><button disabled>Roll</button></td>
                </tr>
            </table>
        </div>
        <p>
            One quick thing I'd like to note, formatting does not matter. If you
            want to add spaces, that's fine. It won't break anything.
        </p>
        <p>
            Dice expressions can be evaluated using the <strong>Roll</strong>
            button, and the result as well as how the computer got to it's
            answer will all be displayed inside of the results section.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hopefully this makes sense. 😭
